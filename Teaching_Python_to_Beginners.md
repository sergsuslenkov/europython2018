## OpenSpace - Teaching Python to Beginners

### Topics to discuss
1.	Focus on the subject (especially children)
2.	Emotional aspect (confidence and fear)
3.	Subject matter for teaching (ways to start)
4.	Conceptual difficulties
5.	Different abilities among students
6.	Order of teaching concepts
7.	PC/tools/stuff to teach
### Discussion Notes
1.	__Emotional aspect__
 * A belief of the teacher in talent will determine their attitude. A teacher who
believes in talent will give up on students they see as "untalented", one who
does not has the motivation to persist with them. Stupid is a state not a
property!
 *	It's better to praise for effort rather than results -- "you worked hard on
 that problem"
 * Students with the courage to try new things do better -- how can we encourage
 the timid?
 * Often we think of younger people and children on this topic, but it affects
 older people too. Some are suffering "culture shock".
 *	Provide ways for little successes -- keep the learning gradient shallow,
 give motivating examples.
 *	Motivation
 *	Show students that even teacher can make mistake, but it is easy to overtake them
 *	Never say: Don’t worry – it is easy. Say: "You did the last one well",
 "Why not give it a try?" or "where do you think you could start?"
 *	Avoid red error messages
 *	Seeing that something is possible is important -- show or use a student’s
 solution as an example, rather than your own
 * Seeing the instructor make mistakes is important -- see this as a normal part
 of the process, and even experienced programmers do it continuously.

2.	__Keeping focus__
 * Make the material as relevant as possible to your students!
 * Keep focus, keep them in a flow - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi - [wiki/Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
 * Immediate results are essential. Ideally the students will be in a state of
 "flow", the two preconditions for this are the right difficulty level (not too
   hard, not too easy) and that there is a tight feedback loop.
 * Set the goals (long term on shorter) – real problems to solve
 * Examples of things like this:
  * games
  * things that can be understood easily
  * visualisations
  * IPyWidgets / graphs to show results of functions
 * Have the exercises be *simple* but *real*:
  * Simplified for the student
  * Real problem to solve
  * Result looks like something you know or use
 * Give existing code for student to tinker with, not get them to build from
 scratch. This will give a visible result quicker.


3. __Subject matter for teaching (ways to start)__
 * Choose a real world problem, if possible.
 * Game goals good way to start
 * Visual goals
 * Jupyter Notebooks with widgets - keeps things visual and interactive
 * Physical computing
 * "How would you fix this?" broken code challenges.
 * Test Driven Teaching -- give the student unit tests and they fill in
 implementation
 * Teach <subject> in hard way (books by Zed Shaw) -- shows the debugger first!

4. __Conceptual difficulties__
 * Some students have never heard of mathematical functions! An example of
very specific "blind spots" -- there are many others
 * Explain in different words (functions for maths are confusing)
 * Don’t push on some subject if it is not critical, probably they come to it later
 * other students may explain to the fellow. It helps develop personal relationships, build a team
 * involve students to act out being a function/variable/turtle/class – make it real life.
   (DEBUG async code with people per function!)
 * Teach two languages at the time – to show that language is not the goal, it is interchangeable
 * Better error messages (think Mu has improved this a little)
 * Teach students to break up problems -- it's not like writing an essay.

5. __Different abilities among students__
 * Involve other students to help other, especially for the problem he can solve
 * Take last year students as assistants
 * People that attend but does not want to do anything. They just want it to happen
  * Make format less academic – make it a workshop
  * Provide lecture in advance as recording, make it interactive during the class
 * Group students with mixed level like code dojos (but not too different levels)
 * Have some simple materials for slow students, have more difficult tasks for advanced
 * Have prepared flow, so most of the audience can flow by themselves, and you focus on blocked folks
